  <p> 
   While I don't know how to create the filling, I know how to fold 
   dumplings. You would have to cover the edges of the wrapping with 
   egg or water, then add the filling. Afterwards, fold it like a 
   burrtio and only connect the top
   bottom. For the sides, slowly fold it but don't stick it together. 
   Push one side to the top and fold the other. I know it sounds 
   complciated in text but it's easier to just to watch someone do it.
   Why don't you look at this <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-fold-a-chinese-dumpling/"> tutorial </a>. It's a little different from 
    how I was taught but it's still relevant.

    It's also known as a Chinese egg crepe. I know how to make a 
    basic version but it took forever to figure out. I want to test out
    more fillings and improve on cooking the egg.
