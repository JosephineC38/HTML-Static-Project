      I'm currently waiting for many things to come out.
      One of then is the Paper Mario: Thousand-Year Door Remaster. 
      It's a game I always wanted to play. 
    </p>

    <a href="likedVideo.mp4"> Download video </a>   
    <p>
      Oh no, your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ume5pSIcKE">link 
      to the video</a> instead.

      I couldn't access it before because it would require 
      spending hundreds of dollars on both a console and the 
      game itself. Now, I'm hoping that it doesn't cost $60 and 
      will have more features. Another thing I'm looking forward 
      to is the next movie of Madoka Magia, an anime.

     All of the protagonists have new desgins and I'm hoping it
     explains more about the origins of the main antagonist 
     Walpurgisnacht. Despite kickstarting the entire plot, there
     is nothing about her history.
